//! Tauri glue for the transport actor: three commands in, one event stream out.
//!
//! The WebView never touches the network. It calls `transport_connect` /
//! `transport_send` / `transport_disconnect`, and consumes every
//! [`TransportEvent`] (status + frames) from the `loreweaver://transport`
//! event channel. Each explicit connect carries a **bridge** connection id —
//! stamped onto the envelope, never onto the protocol wire frame — so the
//! WebView can drop events from a generation it has already left.
//!
//! The slot knows whose actor it is holding. Commands cross the IPC boundary
//! as independent tasks, so they can be handled out of the order the WebView
//! issued them: a slow connect from a generation the operator has already left
//! must not tear down the live actor and seat itself in its place, because the
//! WebView drops everything that replacement emits while accepting the offline
//! the healthy actor emits on its way out. That is a working table taken apart
//! by a redial nobody is waiting for.
