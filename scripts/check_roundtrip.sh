# Cross-repo round-trip gate (studio ↔ engine), the automated half of the
# cross-repo contract:
#
#   1. lorecard v1 byte drift — the REAL `exportNativeBundle` output must stay
#      byte-identical to the engine's pinned tests/fixtures/studio_export.lorecard.json
#   2. pack manifest v2 full-tree build — the REAL `buildPackSourcePlan` tree
#      must build clean through the engine's REAL parsers, with the expected
#      detection results (world card, hooks, presentation kit) in `trust`
#   3. the engine's own conformance suites for the pinned fixtures
#      (studio_export + lorecard + visible_when + panel template golden vectors),
#      and the two vendored vector tables are byte-identical to the engine's
# Prerequisite: the engine's optional `ejs` extra (`uv sync --extra ejs`) — the
# fixture ships a stage-E rules-script rulepack, which compiles through QuickJS
# at pack-build time.
#
#   4. the live-connect smoke gate — a REAL `--serve` engine dialed through the
#      REAL Rust transport (scripts/check_live_connect.sh). The formats above
#      are all static; this is the only stage that proves the two processes can
#      still talk. Set LIVE_CONNECT=0 to skip it on a machine without cargo.
#
# Usage:  bash scripts/check_roundtrip.sh        (or: bun run roundtrip)
# Engine repo: $TRPG_KP_REPO, default ../trpg_kp (sibling checkout).
